## paper on Protein-Protein Interactions

### Background

Most of the cellular processes are governed by proteins, mostly working in groups as well-oiled machinery. Any hiccups in already established mechanism (obviously through evolution) may lead to the development of many diseases. Hence, it is of importance to understand protein interactions - permanent or transient; direct or functional, specific or non-specific. Over the years, there has been a continuous efforts to understand different layers and improve on the previously proposed methods. These works differ in the data used (sequences, metadata), (ML or non-ML approaches) etc. Each year number of papers are published that works on PPI prediction problem. 

This repository is one of the first public (to best of my knowledge) that compiles the papers specific to the protein interaction prediction domain. I hope this repository will be useful for people interested in this field.

Phase 1: Categorizing Papers in different categories
Phase 2: Providing summary for each of the paper.
Phase 3: Keep Updating the repository

Status: Pre-Phase1, many changes expected in coming days.

## Acknowledgement:
It was a long pending thought, but looking at Kevin K. Yang repository https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins motivated me to put together this repository.


### Format

Within each category, papers are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first). Where possible, a link should be provided.
